# SAIL-Plasma
Repository for Python Code Relating to the Project PyTHAGORA or Project BeAMED at the Space and Atmospheric Instrumentation Lab, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

## Project PyTHAGORA
***Py**thon **T**raining for **H**eliophysics, **A**stronomy, and **G**eosciences: an **O**pencourse for **R**esearchers with **A**pplications*  
Project PyTHAGORA is a self-guided, open source, cross-platform training course for the purpose of teaching Python to an absolute beginner with relevent examples to current applications across a variety of industries. 

## Project BeAMED
***Be**nch for **A**utomated **M**easurements of **E**lectrical **D**ischarges*  
Project BeAMED seeks to characterize the initiation of dielectric breakdown in planetary atmospheres. This is done by inilizing plasma discharges in a dusty plasma chamber in the Space and Atmospheric Instrumentation Laboratory. The experimental outputs (including error bars) will be compared with Riousset et al.’s (2024) generalized Townsend’s theory for Paschen curves in planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometries.  
Included in this repository are the Python files for the user interface (UI) that will operate the dusty plasma chamber. Operation of the chamber includes automated piloting of the following elements:
* a mass flow controller (MFC) for a precision back-fill of the gas mixtures;
* a microcurrent sensor that triggers recordings of the voltage, current, and pressure;
* two motorized linear feedthroughs for higher precision in gap size variations;
* a Dust dispensing And Retaining Equipment (DARE) to explore the feasibility of triboelectric charging in the initiation of electrical discharges in Mars’ atmosphere.
