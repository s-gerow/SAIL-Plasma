Each case is a different view that you may want: if you want a 2D view it can be either x-y,x-z,y-z and each case then uses ```ax.plot(x,y)``` to plot the desired trajectory; or 3D uses ```ax.plot3D(x,y,z)``` to generate a 3D plot. These case statements also create a point representing the particle, some axis labels, and a text label which dispays the time in seconds. With only the output from this match-case statement we would have a plot with teh trajectory, a stationary point, and a label that says 0.00 seconds, which is not very useful.\n","\n","  To animate the plot we use the update function which we defined. This function takes the entire x, y, and z (if applicable) arrays and changes the point location to a point in those arrays. It can also update the time label so that it shows a different time each update. By combining this function with matplotlib's ```FuncAnimation()``` Python will plot the point and then update the points location over and over again, moving through the trajectory one point at a time for the duration of the trajectory. This creates an animation which can then be saved as a .gif.\n","  \n","  \n","  To see all of this in action move onto the next section and begin working through the Particle in Field Project."],"metadata":{"id":"ubvPXfoXkZMU"}}]}
