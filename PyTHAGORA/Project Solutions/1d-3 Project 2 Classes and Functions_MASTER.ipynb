Unfortunately, this method falls apart when you test it for non-perfect squares. Your result from above for the square root of 8 should be ```None```. This is because there is no real integer which is the square root of 8; in fact, the square root of 8, and the square root of all non-perfect integers, is an irrational number and cannot be precisely calculated.

    "Hopefully you noticed that as you decreased the step size, the time to complete the algorithm got longer. This is a perfect example of the tradeoff between precision and resources comes in. To get a highly precise answer with any algorithm it will need to run for longer, which uses more resources. That being said, our algorithm is highly innefficient and will become unreasonably slow signifigantly slower than other onces which have since been developed. \n",

This means in order to get an \"exact value\" of the square root we would need to iterate for step sizes of 0.0000000000000001. Over such a small range of 100 integers this is already 1 quintillion iterations. Even with that. The way that python's floating point storage works may still introduce errors since floating point comparison like ```0.1+0.2 == 0.3``` does not work. I will not go into tremendous depth on how this works, if you are interested there are several good articles which describe the problem here: _____.\n",

    "You can choose whatever you want as your near value but I suggest to start with a fairly high value such as 0.01; then slowly decreasing it and observing the effect it has on your answers. If you change your ```sqrtish()``` function to print valid i values instead of return, then it will print every single one it comes by."

    "You should notice that if your step size is lower, and the near-value cutoff is higher then there are hundreds to thousands of values that are close to the correct answer. Most of them though are pretty close to each other. So if we round off the value to 4 decimal places we will be close-ish to the correct answer. Do this. Also, change the print back to the return. It will unfortuneatly return the first value that satisfies the requirements and this could be lower than we want it to be, but hopefully our step size precision allowed us to get close enough to remove this discrepency by rounding."
