    "In [1d-1 Functions](../Module1_BaseTrack/1d-1%20Functions.ipynb), I very breifly mentioned packages, modules, and libraries. These are openly available bundles of code that fulfill some programming need. In many cases, if you are attempting to solve a complex problem in Python, it has already been done for you in a package. As such, for many people, the first step in a Python project is first determining if someone else has solved the problem already; and if they have, can you use their package in your project, or do you need to reimplement the solution to fit your specific needs? In Module 1, I taught you (hopefully) most of the Python knowledge you will need to solve many problems. However, if you are industry or research bound, you will likely need more than just generic Python; with Module 2 I hope to teach you the basics of several \"foundational\" Python packages that I have encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, recall from Module 1 how to import a module: `import [module name]`. In all projects and lessons up to now you have only used packaged that come pre-built into Python such as `math`, `time`, `logging`, `os`, and `IO`. These packages are so fundamental that they are included in the Python build so that everyone automatically has access to them and when a new Python release comes out, they are already compatible. Any other packages you need you will first need to download to your machine. If you are not familiar with this process, it can get confusing so I will be sure to include ample links to external resources."

    "Many computers that you can buy pre-set up will come with some sort of Python installation already. Most Linux systems and MAC OS X systems are ready to run Python scripts right out of the box, Windows systems are less consistent. In the case that you are on a system that has a version of Python pre-installed, that version will be located in your system files alongside other necessary files. For example, by using `which -a python3` in my terminal on my mac I get the following output:\n",

    "These Python folders will hold all the information necessary for your computer to run a .py file, including packages. Unfortunately, package developers do not always update a package immediately after a new Python version is released. If the new Python version is released and somehow breaks a package you need, you have a few options: install an older version of Python and continue to operate on that version until the package you need is updated, join the development team for the package you need and see through the update yourself, rebuild the functions you need on your own, or destroy your computer and cry.\n",

You can create a virtual enviornment of any Python version you want, install as many packages as you want for that version, and run python files using that enviornment. Then, when you want to switch to a different project which needs a different Python version, you can switch back to the default, or a different virtual enviornment altogether, and do not need to be concerned about version conflicts. This is what I recommend you do.\n",

    "At the heart of numpy is vectorization. If you are familiar with MATLAB, then you are aware of data vectorization. MATLAB stores all information in arrays, so a single integer is actually an array of size 1, which holds an integer in its first index. This quality makes matlab incredibly good at storing large ammounts of data and working with in in an array format, including: dot and cross products, matrix identities, transposing or transforming data, and also simple element-wise math on large arrays of data. Python on its own does not have these capabilities. Storing information in lists is both time and resource heavy as well as just not optimized for vast datasets. Numpy, however, fills that gap excellently; Numpy provides Python with vectorization and array capabilities that it normally does not have. The C-base for Numpy also makes it incredibly quick, making Python with Numpy a great choice for people needing to do data analysis on large amounts of data like astronomers."
