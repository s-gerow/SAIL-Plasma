Python is dynamically typed which means that variables are assigned a type based on the value they carry at *runtime*. *Runtime* is the period of time in which a programming interpreter is running code. So in the above cell, when you click run Python will create an object called `x` which is an integer, then it will create an object called `y` which is also an integer. But to save space, because `x` and `y` are the same integer, Python can store them in the same place. If this is losing you it is okay, people spend their entire careers learning data management in computer progamming, but imagine you had a shelf with a bunch of buckets on it. Each bucket can store only so many things, say 256, and you only have so many buckets. Now, say you have 4 letters which spell the word \"five\", you want to store this, so you put it in bucket number 1. Even though the bucket has a capacity of 256, because you put something in it, it is now locked into holding that thing until you decide to empty the bucket.  \n",
    "Imagine now that you are given another 4 strips of paper which spell out the word \"five\", you unfortunately cannot put them in bucket 1 because it is already used. So instead you put it in bucket 2. But now you are storing a total of 8 things in all buckets. And, for some horrible reason, you are charged $1000 for every item you store in the buckets, so you need to pay $8000. It is in fact cheaper then, for you to write a single strip of paper with the number \"1\" in it and put that in bucket 2 instead. Now you are only storing 5 total items, saving $3000. That is awesome.  \n",
    "But what happens when someone tells you to look in bucket 2 and asks what is in there? Well you open the bucket and see 1, then you move to bucket 1 and read the information stored there. In a sense, bucket 2 *pointed* to bucket 1. This is how computer memory works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we use the ```is``` operator it is checking to see if the object ```x``` and the object ```y``` *point* to the same thing. If they do, then it will return ```True```, otherwise it will return ```False```. Now the reason that this does not work on type, is because the type of object is determined by the value stored in the variable, and not by where the variable points. Or in other words: when we put the \"five\" in bucket 1 it became red, meaning its storing a string. And when we added the pointer it also became red because it is pointing to a string. But when we ask \"is bucket 1 bucket 2?\" that is not asking if they're both red, it's only asking if they are pointing to the same information. Now let's say we had a bucket somewhere which stored the what color the buckets became when they are a different kind of value. That bucket does not store the word \"five\", it stores a bunch of other irrelevent information. So saying \"is bucket 1 bucket red?\" means absolutely nothing because the information in each bucket is wildly different and so you get the result ```False```.\n",

    "\n",
    "If this doesn't make a lot of sense to you it is okay, the important thing is to remember that **```is``` does not check if the values are the same, it checks if the objects point to the same memory location.** If you want to compare values you should use ```==``` and if you want to compare types you use ```isinstance(object, type)```."

    "```isinstance()``` is less of an operator and more of a function but it is similar enough to put here. The ```isinstance()``` function works like how we hoped ```is``` would work above: it determines if an input is a given type. Or in other words, is a given object an instance of a type of object, this can be both default Python types or objects that you create. This works great for finding if something is a required type to perform an action on; for example, you cannot iterate over an integer so you should double check to make sure you dont try to do it accidentally."

Often, sensors output some analog signal, maybe between 0 and +10 Volts. Depending on the situation we only want to know a 1 or 0 value depending on the input. Say for example if it is less than 5V we say it is off (0), and more than 5V is on (1). We can do this with an if statement structure, or just a comparison assignment like below:"
