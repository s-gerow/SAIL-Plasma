    "If you are coming from another langauge such as C or MATLAB, you may have noticed the lack of a switch statement in this previous seciton. Python does not have a switch statement, but it does have an alternative that may be more powerful in some specfic cases. The match-case (and also the switch) statement works very much like an if-elif statement but has some more intricate logic behind it.\n",

    "While an if-elif statement looks simply for boolean values, the match-case statement looks for patterns and value matches. Because the difference is fairly minute in most cases, I will simply show an example where match-case is better and an example of where match-case is essentially the same. If you would like to read more about the intricacies here is the [PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/) for match-case, as well as a few helpful articles I have found on the topic: \n",

    "The match-case statement works by typing the word \"match\", followed by the object you are evaluating, then a colon. Within, the match, for each new comparison you can type \"case\" followed by the pattern you want it to match. If the object and the pattern match then Python will evaluate only that case statement. Much like an elif chain. \n",
