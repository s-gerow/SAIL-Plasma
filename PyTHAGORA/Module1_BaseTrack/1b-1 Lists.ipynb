This can be done with the ```reverse()``` method. Like the ```sort()``` method, ```reverse()``` is a function tied to the list class which means, just like ```sort()```, it permanently changes the list. That being said, you can always return to the original by applying the reverse method again."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710709652008,"user":{"displayName":"Seth G","userId":"15300733208633403854"},"user_tz":240},"id":"ZzOhMtaoOuyb","outputId":"d4830890-7b93-4803-eff4-0f30e0c9f226"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["['coffee', 'tea', 'apple juice', 'soda']\n","['soda', 'apple juice', 'tea', 'coffee']\n","['coffee', 'tea', 'apple juice', 'soda']\n"]}],"source":["drinks = ['coffee', 'tea', 'apple juice', 'soda']\n","print(drinks)\n","drinks.reverse()\n","print(drinks)\n","drinks.reverse()\n","print(drinks)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mxsI916FP3J_"},"source":["### Length Function\n","One of the more important functions for lists is the ```len()``` function.
